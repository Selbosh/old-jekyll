Today I gave a Young Researchers' Meeting (YRM) talk at the University of Warwick.

Here is a list of ten randomly-sampled facts about Carl Friedrich Gauss, courtesy of the `gaussfacts` package.


```r
if(!require(gaussfacts)) install.packages('gaussfacts')
cat('', replicate(10, gaussfacts::gaussfact()), sep = '\n- ')
```


- After reading a Gauss textbook, Maxwell decided to retire and dedicate its life to coffee.
- Hilbert's problems are a compilation of twenty-three problems Hilbert took from a list of exercises Gauss had left to the reader in one of his manuscripts.
- "Gau√ü's theorem" is a pleonasm.
- Gauss can square the circle and trisecate the angle with compass and straightedge
- Not only does Gauss' general proof of Fermat's Last Theorem use only elementary arithmetic, it uses only minuses.
- A mathematician, a physicist, and an engineer walk into a bar. The bartender says, "Hello, Professor Gauss."
- Protons suffered an emotional breakdown.  Gauss said "keep it together" and they haven't decayed since.
- All theorems were once called "The Gauss Theorem", however Gauss allowed others to take credit so it wouldn't confuse everyone else.
- Heisenberg came up with the Uncertainty Principle because he was not as certain as Gauss.
- Gauss can count to aleph one.

Here is a picture of Maunga Whau (Mt Eden) volcano in New Zealand.
