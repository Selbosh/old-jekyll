Where is a student's tea distributed? Probably in a teapot. Thus the [Student's t-distribution teapot](http://www.zazzle.co.uk/students_t_distribution_teapot-180267930175357597) is born.

Warmly emblazoned across the outside is the probability density function of [Student's t-distribution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student's_t-distribution), in case you need to estimate the mean of a normally distributed population and pour a cup of tea at the same time.

Lovingly designed for students and academics who take their probability and statistics as seriously as they take a proper brew. You can get one for yourself [from Zazzle](http://www.zazzle.co.uk/students_t_distribution_teapot-180267930175357597). Goes nicely with a [t-set mug](/t-set).
