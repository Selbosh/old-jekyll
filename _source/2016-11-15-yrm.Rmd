title: "Young Researchers' Meeting"

Today I gave a Young Researchers' Meeting (YRM) talk at the University of Warwick.

Here is a list of ten randomly-sampled facts about Carl Friedrich Gauss, courtesy of the `gaussfacts` package.

```{r chuck, results = 'asis', message = FALSE}
if(!require(gaussfacts)) install.packages('gaussfacts')
cat('', replicate(10, gaussfacts::gaussfact()), sep = '\n- ')
```

Here is a picture of Maunga Whau (Mt Eden) volcano in New Zealand.

```{r volcano}
image(volcano, col = terrain.colors(20))
```
